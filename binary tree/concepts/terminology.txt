Tree -> collection of nodes connected by edges
        for n nodes their are n-1 edges.

Subtree -> subset of the tree i.e. tree under any node is a sub tree.

Path −> path refers to the sequence of nodes along the edges of a tree.

Root -> first node of the tree.

Parent −> any node except the root node has one edge upward to a node 
          called parent.

Child −> the node below a given node connected by its edge downward is 
         called its child node.

Siblings -> same parent.

Decendant -> all nodes under one node i.e. all nodes reachable from a node.

Ancestors -> all the nodes along the path from that node to root node.

Degree of node -> no. of children a node is having.

Degree of a tree -> it is the maximum degree of a node among all the nodes 
                    in the tree.

Leaf -> the node which does not have any child node is called the leaf node.

Level of a node -> the count of edges on the path from the root node to that 
                   node. The root node has level 0.

Height of the Tree -> the height of a tree is the length of the longest path 
                      from the root of the tree to a leaf node of the tree.


Height of a node -> the height of a node can be defined as the length of the 
                    longest path from the node to a leaf node of the tree.

Forest -> collection of tree is called a forest.

Binary Tree -> a tree of degree 2 i.e. at max 2 children - 0,1,2.
